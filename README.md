## English 
This encryption and decryption algorithmwan an accidental idea that ocurred to me when I was researching how to be lazy nd quickly figure out how to solve a Rubik's Cube with a computer. It can also be considered a personal hobby.If someone has earlier repos about these, I'm sorry about that. :(
The Another File，CubeKeyEncoder.py，was 100% written by DeepSeek AI. It's used for convert the text into key file into a num string.
## 中文
这个项目是我在想着怎么让电脑帮我快速复原魔方时想到的，仅个人兴趣爱好，如有雷同，纯属巧合。
至于另一个文件CubeKeyEncoder.py，那完完全全就是让DeepSeek写的（我上传文件的时候已经很晚了，而且被魔方运动带来的复杂性搞的焦头烂额）

不过DeepSeek说这么个玩意只需要5阶，20个密钥就能抗量子计算机破解.....我持保留态度
